## Features
Custom Answers: Our chatbot is equipped to provide tailor-made responses based on custom questions, making interactions engaging and contextually relevant.

Information Extraction: Leveraging advanced text analysis techniques, the chatbot can sift through text files, extracting and interpreting specific information, enhancing its ability to provide insightful and accurate responses.

## Getting Started 

Our chatbot is capable of two seperate things, but in both cases it needs text files to extract the related information. 
Therefore the speeches and cleaned folders both contain the relevant text files.
When running the program, you will be presented with a number of options:
- Entering "0" will either end the program or return to a previous menu (each case will clearly be explained).
- Entering "1" will let you gain access to a number of specific utilities where you will then be told to enter different numbers according to the information that you wish to see.
- Entering "2" will at first allow you to ask specific questions and get custom answers.
  In other cases (once again this will clearly be explained) you will gain access to specific instructions.
Once again all of the instructions will clearly be explained when running the program and in the event that you accidentaly entered something other than the available inputs, you will be prompted with another input.
