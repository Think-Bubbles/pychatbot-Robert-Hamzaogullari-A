# ðŸ’»EFREI Python Project : Chatbot



We've made a very rudimental Chatbot, which is capable of analysing text files in a specified path (location). It can do basic things such as detect the most important word in a file or throughout the folder, check if a word was said, what the least important words are, etc.

## How to use :

Upon running the program you will be met with a very simple guide:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   enter 0 if you wish to end the program, and enter any other number or word it tells you to.

## Additional requirements:

None as of 26/11

## Known bugs :

1.  When using the menu, it is possible that if you are asked to enter one of the presidents name but you write another word that was't instructed, then the program will fail. We have not yet added test cases for every parameter.

2. When calculating our IDF score, there is a + 1, it is still unclear why we have been instructed to add this, as it changes a few results (notable functionality number 1 and number 6)
