Welcome to our Chatbot project â€“ a Python-based chatbot designed to provide custom-generated answers and retrieve information from text files.

## User guide :

As mentioned earlier, our Chatbot is capable of 2 seperate things, but in order for it to function, it needs text files.
Once you run the program, you will be presented X a series of instructions : By entering "0", you either end the program or return to the previous section (this will clearly be indicated), by entering "1", you will gain access to the "custom questions" aspect of the chatbot. By entering "2", you will enter the other functionality of our project : extracting and interpreting specific information.

## Installation

TIn order to use this program, please insure that you have the following installed
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.9 or later
- [Math library](https://pypi.org/project/python-math/#files) in case you don't already have it

## Known bugs :

1.  When using the menu, it is possible that if you are asked to enter one of the presidents name but you write another word that was't instructed, then the program will fail. We have not yet added test cases for every parameter.

2. When calculating our IDF score, there is a + 1, it is still unclear why we have been instructed to add this, as it changes a few results (notable functionality number 1 and number 6)
